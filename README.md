A web scraping application that will scrape weather forecast information from https://weather.com and present it in a terminal.

The options that can be passed to this command line application are:
1. The temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
2. The area where you can get the weather forecast
3. Output options where the user of our application can choose between the current forecast, a five-day forecast, a ten-day forecast, and the weekend
4. Ways to complement the output with extra information such as wind and humidity

This application is designed to be extendable, which means that we can create parsers for different websites to get a weather forecast, and these parsers will be available as argument options.
